# My Personal Expense App

An expense tracker application taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). Some differences to the course are:

- The app is built by the latest version of Flutter (v3.3.4).
- Migrate Material button to Adaptive button for displaying different differently based on the device's operating system.
- Using Cupertino widgets for iPhone (date picker and buttons) which are not taught in the course.
