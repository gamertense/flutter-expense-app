# My Personal Expense App

An expense tracker application taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in this course. Some differences to the course are:

- The app is built by the latest version of Flutter (v3.3.4)
- Using Cupertino widgets for iPhone (date picker and button) which are not taught in the course
